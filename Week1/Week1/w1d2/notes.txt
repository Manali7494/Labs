## Dev Workflow

- Programming is a craft

- IMP: What's happeening, and what did you want to happen?

###Project 1
- Define the problem: node sum.js 10 25 --> 35

#### Hint: Always Make sure that you think other options and write code to respond to it.
- text: '23'
- node sum.js --> 12 14 2 --> '28' or '26' or you rdidnt put the right number of numbers
- BEST: Code you don't have to write -> save you money for the owner

HOw to Refractor sum.js

Cogenerate cases --> for people who didn't use them.
Put them first. We debug when it didn't work using python tutor --> google --> change requirements and put it in the logic.

IMPORTANT: YOU CODE IN SUCH A WAY SO THAT YOU GIVE ROOM TO CHANGE IT LATER!!


## Debugging tools:
1) Console.log();
2)Pythontutor.com
3) node debug + breakpoints
